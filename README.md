# OpenStrategy

## Introduction

For many video game players, nothing is more useful than a well-written strategy guide or walkthrough. Unfortunately, finding a well-written guide for any given game isn't necessarily an easy task. While many of these do exist, the pervasive culture of strict copyright enforcement among the guide writers means that new information and developments in new strategies are often fragmented, separated from the guides they could serve to improve. OpenStrategy hopes to change this by creating guides that anyone can use or modify, allowing us to combine all the best strategies in one place.

## Types of Guides

There are numerous types of guides one could potentially create for any given game. The following is a short list of the types of guides OpenStrategy currently strives to provide:

### Perfect Game Walkthroughs

Perfect game walkthroughs are detailed documents that direct a step-by-step path for a player to see everything a game has to offer, as well as to complete a so-called perfect game if they wish. The guide should be general enough that it can also be used as a walkthrough for more casual players. The criteria that define perfection are necessarily game-dependent, but the following represents a basic example of the level system suggested by [JungleJim](http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/30493), [Absolute Steve](http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/45703) and others:

#### Level 0

* Finish the game.

#### Level 1

* Complete all Level 0 requirements.
* Finish all side quests.

#### Level 2

* Complete all Level 1 requirements.
* Level all characters to maximum.
* Have at least one of each item.

#### Level 3

* Complete all Level 2 requirements.
* Have the maximum useful number of each item.

Ultimately, the defined levels will be different for each game, but again, this is just a basic example to illustrate the idea.

### Speed Run Walkthroughs

These are specialized-walkthroughs designed to teach a particular speed running route. It should consist of at least three sections:

#### General Techniques

This section describes the basic techniques needed to speed run a particular game.

#### Detailed Walkthrough

This section provides a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the route, as well as some of the rationale of the routing choices. Providing the rationale may help users come up with alternate routes that may save additional time.

#### Run Notes

Finally, this section provides simple bullet-point notes of exactly what to do that a runner can use during an actual speed run. One can envision ultimately converting these into some kind of checklist that a runner can check off as they progress, especially while they're learning the route.

### Reference Information

These guides provide basic reference information for the game, such as lists of items, weapons or enemies.
